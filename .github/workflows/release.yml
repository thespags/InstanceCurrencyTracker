# description of this workflow, can be anything you want
name: Package and release

# we need to let GitHub know _when_ we want to release, typically only when we create a new tag.
# this will target only tags, and not all pushes to the master branch.
# this part can be heavily customized to your liking, like targeting only tags that match a certain word,
# other branches or even pullrequests.
